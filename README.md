# US GDP Prediction Project

This repository contains my senior capstone project for COSC 499 (Spring 2025) at Whittier College. This project aimed to build a data-driven model to forecast United States GDP using historical data and predictive modeling techniques.

## About the Project

This project was developed as part of my final course in the Computer Science and Economics program at Whittier College. It reflects my academic training and my growing passion for using data to solve real-world economic problems.

The objective was to compare traditional economic forecasting techniques to machine learning methods, and implement a simple yet effective GDP prediction model using Python.

## Key Features

- **Predictive Modeling**: A linear regression model is used to predict future U.S. GDP values based on historical data.
- **Data Visualization**: Generates clean and readable plots to visualize past GDP and predicted future trends.
- **Model Evaluation**: Calculates key performance metrics like MAE, MSE, RMSE, and RÂ² score.
- **Forecast**: Includes predictions for GDP from 2024 to 2028 using historical lagged GDP values.

## Technologies Used

- Python
- Jupyter Notebook
- Pandas, NumPy
- scikit-learn
- Matplotlib

## Files Included

- `GDP.csv`: Raw GDP data (sourced from FRED).
- `COSCProject.ipynb`: Jupyter Notebook containing the full code, analysis, and visualizations.
- `COSCProject_source_code.pdf`: Exported source code for submission.
- `user documentation.pdf`: A guide for running and understanding the project.

## How to Run

1. Clone the repository or download the files.
2. Open the Jupyter Notebook (`.ipynb`) file in your local environment.
3. Run each cell to load the data, train the model, and view predictions/visuals.
4. Optional: Adjust the code to test different models or future years.
